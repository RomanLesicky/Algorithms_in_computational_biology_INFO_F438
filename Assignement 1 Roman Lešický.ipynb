    "#### Explanation of the adaptation made to the algorithm :\n",
    "\n",
    "In this branch-and-bound approach of the recursive brute-force algorithm, everything remains largely identical in terms of the code. Except for the modification of the `bestfold2()` function, where an upper-bound calculation was added, and the `search()` function which has been modified to take into account the prior mentioned method. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to tasks requirements, this second iteration of the HP model is based on branch-and-bound pruning and a greedy heuristic to speed up the algorithm. The adaptation of these has directly improved the runtime as in Task 4 (part 2). For example, for n = 19 the first iteration took approximately 1100 seconds and now with this second one it takes only 4 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, adapting this heuristic approach instead of a deterministic one sped up the algorithm by a factor of 275x times (*Note : this is a subjective calculation for only n = 19 and cannot be generalized*) for a sequence where the first algorithm started to struggle significantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "So by giving up on a deterministic solution we achieved a significant performance gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously stated these are the two different methods which were used to achieve this : \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Pruning done by the branch-and-bound approach : Here we avoid exploring folding paths that can't really lead to a better solution. This is done by calculating an \"optimistic\" estimation of the maximum possible score that could be realistically achieved for the current folding path. If this upper bound is worse than the current best score, the algorithm prunes that branch of the search tree and avoiding on \"wasting\" further time on an unpromising branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Greedy move ordering : So, here instead of trying moves in a fixed order of always Right / Down / Left and Up here the algorithm calculates which moves would immediately result in an H-H contact. Which is the primary goal of the HP model, this in terms allows for swifter exploration of more promising paths first. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this does have some drawback which should be noted such as : \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a risk of missing valid solutions, since this approach uses an upper-bound estimation for pruning this can lead to premature eliminations of some valid paths which could result in an actual valid solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Greedy bias, where this approach might prioritize moves which should provide a \"sonner\" or even immediate better score potentially leading to even earlier pruning. This could in term lead to miss out on better folding conformations that could have emerged later in the search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heuristic limitations, by definition this is a heuristic approach and not a deterministic one. So, there is a risk of not actually finding the optimal folding since we do not explore all the  conformations. If the correct path is pruned the final result might be suboptimal. This is in direct contrast with the first method which guaranteed a through optimal exploration of the folding conformations."

    "### Comparaison of the first method and the second method : \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the first method we see low runtime for low values of n and a spike at a certain value of n, here it comes a bit later on than in the 1st method (around 17 and further). As said before at n = 19 here the runtime is of about 4 seconds which is significantly better than in the first method where this value was about 1100 seconds. Here the key difference as said before is the branch-and-bound pruning which eliminates hopeless branches coupled with a greedy approach that helps to find the solution faster these two speed-up things considerably. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, something which needs to be noted is the big-O time complexity notation for this second method as can be seen in the graphic in Task 4 (part 2) we also get a exponential time-complexity. Since the pruning might be ineffective at times and the algo might still explore all the solutions and just like before in the worst case scenario we can end-up with an $O(3^{n-1})$. This being said empirically this second method is much faster than the first method since many hopeless branches still get pruned which does reduce the number of conformations that need to be fully explored. \n",
